# For the Record (Bootstrap site)

This is a two page site centered around my hobby of record collecting. The goal here was to utilize bootstrap for any styling wherever possible, as well as for certain javascript functionality, including carousels and dropdown menus. Below are the sections which I've included in my site.

## Header

The header is dedicated wholly to the top nav bar, which includes links to the carousel sections, the full collection, and to the homepage (via the logo).

## Hero

The hero section is a banner introducing users to the site, with a large turntable graphic and a secondary link to the full collection.

## Favorite Records

This is a single-item Bootstrap carousel showcasing a selection of my favorite records and a short blurb written for each.

## New Additions

The new additions are another group of albums shown instead using a multi-item carousel.

## Full Collection

The collection is created dynamically from a JSON file which was exported from Discogs. The entries are styled in a dynamic grid.

## Sorting Dropdown

Records on the collection page can be sorted using a Bootstrap dropdown selector.

## Filter Box

An aside is used on the collection page to house filtering options, which can be used to select which records are displayed.

## Footer

The footer mirrors the logo of the top navigation, but then instead includes links to my Github and LinkedIn pages.
